## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- How to structure content using semantic HTML elements
- Applying a mobile-first design approach
- Using Flexbox and Grid together to create responsive layouts
- Styling interactive elements like buttons with hover states

### Continued Development

In the future, I would like to:

- Improve my skills in accessibility (ARIA roles and semantic structure)
- Experiment with more advanced responsive techniques like CSS `clamp()` for fluid sizing
- Try building similar layouts using a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS

### Useful Resources
